"""
I define Suit as an IntEnum with four values and a symbol helper. I use C, D, H, S for
Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades to match the rest of the engineâ€™s two-character
codes.

Key class: Suit; method symbol returns one of C/D/H/S.

Inputs: enum usage. Outputs: canonical suit characters. Invariants: total mapping; no
localization. Dependencies: stdlib enum. Performance: trivial.
